Some time has passed since my first sail. As I reminisce upon it, the joy and frustration tickle my worn capacitance for the mundane. Below is my recollection of that fateful trip. Short but sweet. Brief but telling.

The days leading up to November 3rd, 2019, were filled with their troubles and adventures. From scrambling around to collect as much cashback as humanly possible due to banking issues, wads of bills brimming my pockets as I skated from store to store, to the haphazard preparation that sent me all around Los Angeles. But, nothing before or since could match the simple, exciting fear of kicking off the docks and attempting to do what many consider unthinkable. That is, sailing up the California coast with absolutely no experience with winter onsetting.

As I began to part, full of anxiousness, I yelled to the owner of the Catalina 36 docked beside me, "Otto!" We had spoken a few times in the days leading up. With no response and my worry of hitting one of the many expensive boats nearby unabating, I went on a little louder, "OTTO!" A few moments later, the friendly swede popped his head out from the companionway and came over to assist me. "Are you heading out?" he asked, a hint of vicarious merriment accompanying his voice. "Yep, all ready to go! Mind giving me a hand?" "Of course, what do you need?" I asked him to take ahold of a line attached to the bow and walk the boat out as I reversed out. The rock embankment bordering my slip was uncomfortably close, and I had little trust in the electric motor aboard my vessel. As the bow turned toward the Marina del Rey basin, I pushed the throttle forward and quickly found out what prop walk was. My boat began slowly drifting toward the bow of an expensive powerboat directly perpendicular to my starboard. "Oh no. Push Otto, push!" As he pushed me away with what strength he could muster, the stanchion he was holding on to collapsed inward. "My bad," he said with a chuckle. His efforts having diverted the collision successfully, though, I really couldn't have cared less. "All good. Thank you for the help!"
